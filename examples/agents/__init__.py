"""Multi-agent collaboration examples.

Each agent type is in its own folder with:
- prompts.py: All prompts and configuration (edit this to customize)
- main.py: The execution logic (usually no need to edit)

To copy an agent as a template:
    cp -r examples/agents/dev_coach_base examples/agents/my_new_agent

Then edit my_new_agent/prompts.py to customize.
