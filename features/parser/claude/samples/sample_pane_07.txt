❯ I want to create a text to speech and speech to text program using uv python.. Frontend in tauri and backend in python. Backend should function without frontend as well... Currently both
  frontend and backend are on the same computer but that may not remain the case -- we might have backend to a dedicated server later. Also we want to use the mode parakreet v3 from nvidia. And
  some other opensource models later... figure out the high-level requirements and ask questions. Don't write any code yet.

∴ Thinking…

  The user wants to create a speech application with:
  1. Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) capabilities
  2. Frontend: Tauri (Rust + web tech)
  3. Backend: Python with uv (package manager)
  4. Backend should work standalone (without frontend)
  5. Future consideration: backend might move to dedicated server
  6. Model: Parakeet v3 from NVIDIA (STT model)
  7. Future: other open-source models

  Let me think about the high-level requirements and questions I need to ask before starting implementation.

  Key architectural decisions needed:
  1. Communication protocol between frontend and backend (HTTP REST, WebSocket, gRPC?)
  2. Audio streaming vs file-based processing
  3. Model loading/management strategy
  4. API design for standalone backend use

  Questions I should ask:

  Functional Requirements:
  - Real-time streaming or batch processing?
  - What audio formats need to be supported?
  - Should the app handle long audio files or just short clips?
  - Any language requirements beyond English?

  Architecture:
  - How should frontend and backend communicate? (REST API, WebSocket for streaming, gRPC?)
  - Should audio be streamed in real-time or uploaded as files?

  Model-specific:
  - Parakeet v3 is an STT model - what about TTS? Which model for that?
  - GPU requirements - should it work on CPU as well?
  - Model download/caching strategy?

  Deployment:
  - Docker containerization for backend?
  - Authentication/authorization when moving to server?

  Let me organize these questions properly.

⏺ High-Level Requirements Understanding

  What I understand:
  - STT (Speech-to-Text): Using NVIDIA Parakeet v3 (and other models later)
  - TTS (Text-to-Speech): Model TBD
  - Backend: Python with uv, must work standalone (CLI/API)
  - Frontend: Tauri (Rust + web stack)
  - Deployment: Local now, potentially remote server later

  Questions

  1. Communication & Streaming
  - Real-time streaming (speak and see text appear live) or batch processing (record → process → get result)?
  - For the eventual remote deployment, should we design for WebSocket (streaming) or REST API (request/response), or both?

  2. TTS Model
  - Parakeet v3 is STT only. What TTS model do you want? Options include:
    - Coqui TTS (open source, various voices)
    - Piper (fast, lightweight)
    - NVIDIA models (if staying in ecosystem)
    - Other preference?

  3. Audio Handling
  - Input formats to support? (WAV, MP3, direct mic capture?)
  - Output format for TTS? (WAV, MP3?)
  - Max audio duration to handle?

  4. Hardware Requirements
  - Must it run on CPU-only machines, or can we assume NVIDIA GPU?
  - Any memory constraints to consider?

  5. Standalone Backend Usage
  - CLI interface, REST API, or both for standalone use?
  - Any authentication needed when backend goes remote?

  6. Project Structure Preference
  - Monorepo (frontend + backend together) or separate repos?

  Let me know your thoughts on these, and I can start sketching the architecture.
